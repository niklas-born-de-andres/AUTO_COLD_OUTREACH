THE MISSION

Helmit is the digital helmet for your child on social media. It protects children from digital threats such as cyberbullying, grooming, or inappropriate content while preserving their privacy. Helmit runs locally on the parents’ laptop and pairs with the child's social media accounts by simply scanning a QR code. Once connected, Helmit’s advanced on-device AI model scans conversations for any signs of harmful content across text, audio, images, and video. When a risk is detected, Helmit alerts parents immediately. The children keep their freedom and privacy, since parents only see flagged conversations and the data is processed purely on-device.

We are proud that Helmit successfully uncovered the first cyberbullying case, proving its immediate impact. Further, we secured over 390,000 USD in pre-seed funding to accelerate our mission of making every child’s first smartphone safe.

"The Talent Kick program refined our vision, enhanced our execution capabilities, and strengthened our teamwork."

# Belén Hein & Felix Hermsen: Co-Founders of Neurolytics

Belén Hein & Felix Hermsen are co-founders of [Neurolytics], a startup that uses AI to develop video assessments, so companies can screen employees and job candidates for characteristics such as stress resistance, motivation, and match with the team. Find out why they started working together, learn more about their mission and check out what they think is the next big thing in the Dutch startup ecosystem. **1\. Hi Belén & Felix, thank you for agreeing to do the interview. Could you tell us how you entered the startup world in the first place and why you started working together?**

**Belén:** Felix and I met when I was actively looking for a way to start a scalable business, which was shortly after returning to a corporate job after maternity leave. I realized then how important it is to be doing something you are passionate about. When I met Felix, things immediately clicked. He had a clear vision of what he was building and that inspired me. At the same time, I had experience and skills that were complementary to his. After some weeks and sessions together we decided to start [Neurolytics].

**Felix:** Since I was young, I had a passion for both people and technology. I saw people around me sometimes struggling with life, burnout, depression, and other psychological challenges, while I saw so much joy in the world. So I started studying psychology, neuroscience and briefly did an external PhD trajectory in experimental psychology. I learned a lot, and on the side, I kept reading about technological advancements. I thought there must be a scalable solution to help people and analyze human behaviour more objectively in order to serve, protect, help, cure or better understand them. I ended up talking to an investor who introduced me to Holland Startup, a venture studio in Utrecht, where I met and joined forces with Belén.

On a higher and visionary level we connected from the beginning: we wanted to build a large global tech company for the good of people. We wanted to use scientifically cutting edge technology to help people get the jobs they love and help companies all over the world to hire people who fit their team and company culture.

# Opening doors in Benelux: how Helmes Lithuania built trust through BBinB

###### October 2, 2025

## Over the years, Helmes Lithuania has grown into a trusted partner for complex engineering projects across Europe and the US.

Helmes Lithuania, formerly known as TeleSoftas, has been building digital solutions for more than two decades. The company’s first projects came from the telecommunications industry, and even before the iPhone was released, they were already creating mobile solutions while most of the world was still focused on desktop. What started small has grown into part of the [Helmes Group] – the largest tech hub in the Baltics – contributing to projects for clients such as Airbus, Telia, OECD, CERN, and Kuehne+Nagel. The Group also operates the Baltics’ largest AI and data team, making advanced capabilities available to clients across industries.

Over the years, Helmes Lithuania has grown into a trusted partner for complex engineering projects across Europe and the US. For the team, however, the Benelux region still offered untapped opportunities. “Even with Helmes Group’s presence in the region, for us it remained a market where we saw room to grow,” says [Aidas Vagonis], Partner at Helmes Lithuania. “It’s a digitally mature environment, and we knew we needed more than a cold start – we needed trust and local insight. Having Dutch and Belgian professionals on our team also gives us cultural proximity and language advantages from day one.”

The search for trust and access led them to Benelux Baltics in Business (BBinB). Recommended by people in their network, BBinB stood out not just as a platform for visibility, but as a community where credibility came first. Helmes Lithuania’s first step was to sponsor a BBinB annual event – a way of showing commitment to the region rather than simply arriving to sell. The real turning point came with the personal introductions BBinB arranged, connecting the team directly with decision-makers who were open from the start.

“Entering a new market isn’t about quick wins,” Vagonis reflects. “It’s about showing up, listening, and building trust – one conversation at a time.” According to Vagonis, BBinB played a key role in making the right introductions. Through the initiative, Helmes connected with [Euronics International], Europe’s largest independent electronics retailer. Today, Helmes is working with Euronics on improving supply chain management through AI. “For us, the event is about establishing lasting partnerships,” Vagonis explains.

This outcome reflects a broader philosophy that has shaped Helmes Lithuania since the early days: be the best partner for growth. As Vagonis puts it: “Nearly anyone can build an app or a system – but creating digital tools that help clients increase revenue or decrease costs requires a different mindset.” Nearly all of their Helm Project | High-frequency ELectro-Magnetic technologies for advanced processing of ceramic matrix composites and graphite expansion

Valencia-based company [LOFITH Composites] has closed a €540,000 funding round led by [REDIT Ventures], the investment vehicle promoted by REDIT – the Network of Technological Institutes of the Valencian Community. The round also included participation from three Spanish industrial companies. The capital injection will be mainly used to install the company’s first in-house production line, a key step in its industrial scale-up.

The company, founded as a spin-off from the Plastics Technology Institute AIMPLAS, has developed its own technology in long-fiber thermoplastic composite materials, enabling a significant reduction in material weight. This technology has direct applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, electric mobility, and hydrogen tanks. “We put materials on a diet. If we manage to reduce weight in a vehicle, we make it more efficient. It could be an electric car, a satellite, or even a hydrogen tank,” CEO Amador García told Plaza.

Established in 2023, the company began its commercial activity in September 2024, following more than five years of research at AIMPLAS, where its manufacturing technology was developed. This technology enables the homogeneous bonding of fibers such as carbon or glass with thermoplastic matrices, resulting in lighter materials with improved mechanical properties that are also recyclable—a key differentiating advantage over traditional composite materials.

LOFITH currently manufactures at AIMPLAS facilities, with production capacity limited to just a few tonnes per year. However, market demand is already requiring volumes of between 20 and 50 tonnes, forcing the company to accelerate its industrialization. “Our customers are already asking for much larger quantities. There is no market risk because they know the product and are demanding it. The challenge is to set up our own plant as soon as possible,” García stressed.

“On the one hand, there are the materials and their composition, and on the other, the manufacturing method. How each part is selected and how they are combined is vital,” García explains. “It’s like making mayonnaise: if it doesn’t blend properly, it splits. Our technology ensures full integration, creating a material with superior properties.” LOFITH’s materials are tailored to each customer’s needs and applications, ranging from components for electric vehicles and battery casings to satellite parts or hydrogen tanks, which must withstand extreme conditions. The company currently works with clients in Germany, Denmark, France, and Spain, and is also exploring alternatives using plant-based fibers to meet growing demand for more sustainable solutions.

In this context, the company is already searching for industrial premises, with site visits scheduled to begin next February, which will be fitted out using the proceeds from the new funding round. The plan is [(0)] [it] /[en]

The race toward Net Zero has gained new momentum with the announcement of Mitico and Heath Technologies as the winners of HyAccelerator 2025 – Net Zero Revolution Call4Startup, Snam’s flagship corporate acceleration program focused on pioneering decarbonization technologies.

The initiative, part of Snam’s long-term innovation roadmap, attracted more than 60 proposals from across the globe. Following an intensive Discovery Phase of technical assessments and expert mentoring, the two startups were selected to advance to the Validation Phase, where they will develop pre-feasibility studies for industrial-scale applications. Supported by Snam’s financial and technical resources, the winners will gain access to targeted feedback, expert guidance, and partnerships with key industrial players to explore real-world deployment.

As the world aims to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030 to stay within the 1.5°C global warming threshold, this edition of HyAccelerator reflects the growing need for practical innovation in carbon management and clean hydrogen production—two of the most critical pillars for achieving global Net Zero targets by 2050.

## **Carbon Capture Reinvented: Mitico’s Granulated K₂CO₃ Technology**

Mitico is redefining the boundaries of Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) through its proprietary granulated potassium carbonate (K₂CO₃) sorption process. This technology captures low-concentration CO₂ emissions from post-combustion gases, providing a scalable, non-toxic and cost-effective pathway for decarbonizing industrial assets.

Industrial emissions account for nearly 20% of Italy’s total greenhouse gas output, making carbon capture a strategic priority. Mitico’s system is designed to retrofit existing plants, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as cement, steel, and chemicals, where electrification alone cannot deliver the necessary emission reductions.

Global projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicate that CCUS technologies could contribute up to 15% of total emission cuts required by mid-century. Mitico’s innovation aligns with this global vision, offering a viable industrial tool to support Europe’s low-carbon transition.

## **Heath Technologies and the Future of Hydrogen**

Heath Technologies is developing an innovative hybrid water-splitting process that merges thermochemical and electrochemical steps using the CuCl cycle.

## Meet the new companies joining this EIT Health programme to help healthcare innovators grow beyond their home markets
An additional 15 start-ups will receive assistance in making a soft landing in new European markets after being accepted in the second-round of applications for the[EIT Health Bridgehead Europe programme] in 2020.
The supported start-ups are working on a range of innovations, like two different solutions for screening and protecting blood samples, a filter that cleans a patient’s blood so that it can be reinfused back into their body, systems for remote monitoring of everything from epileptic seizures to pacemakers, and improvements in medical imaging through AI –among others.
The[EIT HealthBridgehead Europe programme] will support the chosen start-ups in moving from their home markets to new markets in Europe, by providing hosting at a local start-up accelerator, and guidance with regulatory and market challenges.
For this second round of 2020 applications, the Bridgehead Europe programme received interest from 80 companies, covering biotech, medtech and digital health solutions. Applicants were evaluated based on the innovativeness of their solution, their business model and traction in the home market, and their need to expand to other European markets.
The selected start-ups will participate in the upcoming Bridgehead Europe Matchmaking Event on 30 June-July 1 2020, where they will have the opportunity to meet the[Bridgehead CATalysers] who will support them, and to start defining their internationalisation path.
