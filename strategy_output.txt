Connection strategy — Leonardo Benini / Helmit

=== BODY ===
Hi Nico,

Here is a focused connection strategy for Leonardo Benini, Co-Founder of Helmit. Research on his personal published content and active social channels came back thin, so the angles below lean on ecosystem and timing instead.

---

WARM INTRODUCTION ANGLES

- Helmit is backed by EWOR, which has a defined network of investors and founders. If Kibo has any prior relationship with EWOR portfolio companies or the EWOR team directly, that is the cleanest path to a warm intro. Worth checking your CRM for any overlap.
- Helmit is TUM-affiliated. If Kibo has invested in or engaged with any other TUM-originated founders or the TUM Venture Labs ecosystem, that is a credible common ground to reference in outreach.
- The co-founder Alexander Wolters holds an MSc, likely from a German-speaking technical university. If there is any overlap in your network there, a dual-founder warm intro could work well.

UPCOMING EVENTS

- Helmit is at pre-seed stage, actively hiring, and has early product-market validation. Leonardo is likely attending European early-stage founder events in the DACH region. Slush (Helsinki, November) draws heavily from the EWOR and TUM ecosystems and is worth monitoring. If Kibo is attending, that is a natural in-person touch point.
- Keep an eye on child safety or EdTech-adjacent events in Munich and Zurich, where Helmit operates. These are smaller but higher-signal settings for a founder at this stage.

CONTENT HOOKS

- Helmit publicly announced uncovering its first real cyberbullying case. This is a concrete milestone worth referencing directly. A message that acknowledges the weight of that moment, not just the metrics, will stand out versus generic investor outreach.
- Helmit is currently running three open roles simultaneously at pre-seed stage, which signals aggressive growth intent. Referencing that Kibo understands the pressure of scaling a team at this stage, and has resources or network to help, gives the outreach a practical hook beyond capital.

NOTE ON GAPS

No verified personal LinkedIn activity, Twitter/X presence, podcast appearances, or articles by Leonardo were surfaced in research. Before sending outreach, a quick manual check of his LinkedIn profile for recent posts would be worth five minutes. If he has posted about the cyberbullying case milestone or the funding round, engaging with that post directly before emailing is the simplest warm-up move available.

---

Recommended sequence: LinkedIn engagement on any recent post, followed by a short direct message referencing the first cyberbullying case detection as a genuine signal of impact, then email if no response within one week.

Let me know if you want a draft outreach message built around any of these angles.

Best,
[Your name]
